# AI Music App ðŸŽµ

**Generated by Multi-Agent Collaboration using MultiAgenticSwarm**

This Flutter application was collaboratively developed by three AI agents:

- **ðŸŽ¨ Flutter_UI_Agent**: Created the user interface and screens
- **ðŸŽµ Flutter_Audio_Agent**: Built the audio service and playback functionality  
- **ðŸ“Š Flutter_Data_Agent**: Designed the data models and architecture

## Features Generated by AI Agents

âœ… **Clean Flutter Architecture**
- Properly structured lib/ directory with models, screens, and services
- Material Design 3 UI components
- Modular code organization

âœ… **AI-Generated Components**
- `Track` data model with JSON serialization
- `HomeScreen` with Material Design 3 theming
- `AudioService` with state management using ChangeNotifier

âœ… **Real Agent Collaboration**
- Agents made actual calls to Anthropic Claude LLM
- Progress board coordination between agents
- No hardcoded Flutter code - everything AI-generated

## Getting Started

1. Ensure Flutter is installed (`flutter doctor`)
2. Run `flutter pub get` to install dependencies  
3. Run `flutter run` to start the app

## Architecture

```
lib/
â”œâ”€â”€ main.dart           # App entry point
â”œâ”€â”€ models/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ track.dart      # Music track data model
â”œâ”€â”€ screens/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ home_screen.dart # Main app screen
â””â”€â”€ services/
    â””â”€â”€ audio_service.dart # Audio playback service
```

## AI Agent Collaboration

This app demonstrates successful multi-agent collaboration where:
1. **Data Agent** created the `Track` model with proper Dart conventions
2. **UI Agent** built the `HomeScreen` with Material Design 3 components
3. **Audio Agent** implemented the `AudioService` with ChangeNotifier pattern

All code was generated through real LLM calls, not hardcoded templates!
