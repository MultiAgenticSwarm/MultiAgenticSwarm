# Tool Management System

## Overview

The Tool Management System provides dynamic, permission-based access to tools for all agents. Unlike traditional systems where tools are hardcoded to agents, our system uses runtime discovery and centralized execution.

## Architecture

### Centralized ToolNode

#### File Location
`multiagenticswarm/core/tool_node.py` (To be created)

#### Core Concept
Single ToolNode serves all agents:
- Centralized execution point
- Uniform error handling
- Consistent logging
- Performance monitoring

#### Benefits
- Simplified permission management
- Easy tool addition/removal
- Central monitoring point
- Reduced complexity

### Tool Registry

#### File Location
`multiagenticswarm/core/tool_registry.py` (To be created)

#### Registry Structure
{
"tool_id": {
"name": "display_name",
"description": "what_it_does",
"category": "tool_category",
"function": callable_function,
"schema": {input_schema},
"output_schema": {output_schema},
"permissions": {permission_matrix},
"quotas": {usage_limits},
"metadata": {additional_info}
}
}

#### Registry Operations

##### register_tool()
- Validates tool function
- Converts to LangChain format
- Stores in registry
- Updates ToolNode

##### discover_tools()
- Semantic search by description
- Filter by category
- Check availability
- Return matching tools

##### update_permissions()
- Modify access matrix
- Apply immediately
- Log changes
- Notify affected agents

## Permission System

### Permission Matrix

#### File Location
`multiagenticswarm/core/tool_permissions.py` (To be created)

#### Matrix Structure
   Tool1  Tool2  Tool3  Tool4
Agent1   ✓      ✗      C      ✓
Agent2   ✓      ✓      ✗      C
Agent3   G      ✓      ✓      ✓
Legend:
✓ = Allowed
✗ = Denied
G = Global (all agents)
C = Conditional (context-dependent)

#### Permission Types

##### Static Permissions
Defined in configuration:
- Always allowed/denied
- Role-based access
- Capability-based access

##### Dynamic Permissions
Evaluated at runtime:
- Context-dependent
- State-based conditions
- Quota availability
- Time-based restrictions

##### Conditional Permissions
Based on conditions:
- Task type
- Data sensitivity
- User approval
- Performance metrics

### Permission Flow

#### 1. Tool Request
Agent/node requests tool usage

#### 2. Permission Check
Check Process:

Is tool available?
Does agent have base permission?
Are conditions met?
Are quotas available?
Is approval needed?


#### 3. Grant/Deny Decision
Based on all checks

#### 4. Execution or Rejection
Tool executes or error returned

## Tool Discovery

### Semantic Search

#### Implementation
Vector embeddings for tool descriptions:
- Embed tool descriptions
- Embed search queries
- Find nearest neighbors
- Rank by relevance

#### Discovery API
discover_tools(
query="find tools for data analysis",
agent_id="requesting_agent",
context=current_state,
limit=5
)

### Tool Recommendations

#### Based on Task
Analyze current task and suggest tools

#### Based on History
Recommend frequently used tools

#### Based on Success
Suggest tools with high success rates

#### Based on Similarity
Find tools similar to ones already used

## Tool Execution

### Execution Flow

#### 1. Request Validation
- Check parameters
- Validate schema
- Verify permissions
- Check quotas

#### 2. Pre-execution
- Log request
- Start metrics
- Prepare context
- Set timeout

#### 3. Execution
- Call tool function
- Monitor progress
- Handle streams
- Catch errors

#### 4. Post-execution
- Process results
- Update metrics
- Log outcome
- Update quotas

### Error Handling

#### Tool Failures
- Retry with backoff
- Try alternative tools
- Graceful degradation
- Error propagation

#### Permission Errors
- Clear error message
- Suggest alternatives
- Request approval
- Log attempt

#### Quota Exceeded
- Queue for later
- Request increase
- Use alternative
- Notify user

### Result Management

#### Result Caching
- Cache successful results
- TTL-based expiry
- Key by parameters
- Invalidation rules

#### Result Formatting
- Standardize output
- Add metadata
- Include timing
- Attach context
