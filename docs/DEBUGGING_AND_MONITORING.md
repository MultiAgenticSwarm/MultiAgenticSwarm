# Debugging and Monitoring Documentation

## Overview

Comprehensive debugging and monitoring capabilities are essential for understanding, troubleshooting, and optimizing the multi-agent system.

## Time-Travel Debugging

### Checkpoint System

#### File Location
`multiagenticswarm/core/debugging.py` (To be created)

#### Checkpoint Structure
Checkpoint:
id: unique_identifier
thread_id: conversation_id
timestamp: when_created
graph_version: current_graph
state: complete_state_snapshot
metadata:
trigger: what_caused_checkpoint
node: where_in_graph
agent: active_agent
phase: execution_phase

#### Checkpoint Operations

##### Creating Checkpoints
Automatic checkpoints at:
- Every node completion
- Before risky operations
- After state changes
- On errors

##### Accessing Checkpoints
Operations:

list_checkpoints(thread_id)
get_checkpoint(checkpoint_id)
get_checkpoint_at_time(timestamp)
get_latest_checkpoint()


##### Using Checkpoints
Debugging Actions:

Load checkpoint
Inspect state
Modify state
Resume from checkpoint
Compare checkpoints


### Time-Travel Operations

#### Replay Execution
Replay from any checkpoint:
1. Load checkpoint
2. Set starting point
3. Run with same or different inputs
4. Compare outcomes

#### State Comparison
Compare states across time:
1. Select two checkpoints
2. Generate diff
3. Visualize changes
4. Identify issues

#### Branch Exploration
Try different paths:
1. Load checkpoint
2. Modify state or inputs
3. Execute alternate path
4. Compare results
