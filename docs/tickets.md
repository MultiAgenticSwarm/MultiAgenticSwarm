## **Epic 1: Core State Management**

### **Ticket #1: Create Core State Schema**
**Priority:** ðŸ”´ Critical  
**Story Points:** 5  
**Dependencies:** None  
**Assignee:** Can be worked independently

#### **Current Implementation:**
- State is scattered across multiple components
- ProgressBoard writes to JSON files in `multiagenticswarm/tools/collaboration_tools.py`
- No centralized state definition
- Agents communicate through file I/O

#### **Issues:**
- File I/O is slow and not scalable
- No type safety for data flow
- Cannot checkpoint or restore state
- Difficult to debug state changes

#### **Our Solution:**
Create a TypedDict-based state schema that serves as the single source of truth for all data flowing through the system. This state will travel through the graph carrying all information.

- Agent outputs and progress tracking
- Tool permissions and results
- Collaboration context and rules
- Inter-agent communication
- Memory layers (working, short-term)

#### **Example:**
```
Before: Agent writes update to JSON file
After: Agent updates state["updates"] field directly
```

#### **Success Criteria:**
- [ ] State schema defined with proper typing

#### **Our Solution:**
Build adapter that exposes graph structure and execution state to LangGraph Studio.

#### **Files to Create:**
- `multiagenticswarm/core/studio_adapter.py` - Studio integration

#### **Implementation Details:**
- Export graph structure
- Stream execution events
- Provide state snapshots
- Enable studio controls

#### **Example:**
```
Studio shows:
- Current graph topology
- Active nodes highlighted
- State values in real-time
- Message flow visualization
```

#### **Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Studio connection works
- [ ] Graph visualization
- [ ] Real-time updates
- [ ] State inspection
- [ ] Execution control

## **Epic 10: Runtime Adaptation**

### **Ticket #23: Build Configuration Change Detector**
**Priority:** ðŸŸ¡ High  
**Story Points:** 5  
**Dependencies:** None  
**Assignee:** Can be worked independently

#### **Current Implementation:**
- No change detection
- Manual restart required
- No hot-reload capability

#### **Issues:**
- Cannot detect changes
- No automatic updates
- Requires manual intervention
- Poor developer experience

#### **Our Solution:**
Create system that monitors configuration and triggers recompilation when changes detected.

#### **Files to Create:**
- `multiagenticswarm/core/config_watcher.py` - Change detection
- `multiagenticswarm/core/config_validator.py` - Validate changes

#### **Implementation Details:**
- File watcher for config
- API endpoint for updates
- Change validation
- Diff generation
- Recompilation trigger

#### **Example:**
```
Change flow:
1. Config file modified
2. Watcher detects change
3. Validates new config
4. Triggers graph recompilation
5. Hot-swaps at safe point
```

#### **Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Change detection works
- [ ] Validation functional
- [ ] Diff generation accurate
- [ ] Trigger mechanism works
- [ ] API endpoint available

### **Ticket #24: Implement Safe Point Detection**
**Priority:** ðŸŸ¡ High  
**Story Points:** 5  
**Dependencies:** #23  
**Assignee:** Needs change detector

#### **Current Implementation:**
- No safe point concept
- Immediate interruption
- Potential data loss

#### **Issues:**
- Unsafe interruptions
- State corruption risk
- No graceful transitions
- Data loss possible

#### **Our Solution:**
Identify and wait for safe points before graph swapping to ensure data integrity.

#### **Files to Create:**
- `multiagenticswarm/core/safe_points.py` - Safe point logic

#### **Implementation Details:**
Safe points:
- Node boundaries
- Checkpoint completion
- No active tools
- Human approval points
- Error recovery points

#### **Example:**
```
Safe point detection:
- Current node completes
- State checkpointed
- No pending operations
- Safe to swap graph
```

#### **Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Safe points identified
- [ ] Detection accurate
- [ ] Wait mechanism works
- [ ] No data loss
- [ ] Smooth transitions

## **Epic 11: Testing & Validation**

### **Ticket #25: Create Integration Test Suite**
**Priority:** ðŸŸ¡ High  
**Story Points:** 8  
**Dependencies:** All previous tickets  
**Assignee:** After main implementation

#### **Current Implementation:**
- Basic unit tests only
- No integration tests
- No end-to-end validation

#### **Issues:**
- No comprehensive testing
- Integration issues undetected
- No performance benchmarks
- No regression testing

#### **Our Solution:**
Build comprehensive test suite covering all integration points and workflows.

#### **Files to Create:**
- `tests/integration/test_graph_compilation.py` - Compiler tests
- `tests/integration/test_state_flow.py` - State management tests
- `tests/integration/test_agent_execution.py` - Agent tests
- `tests/integration/test_patterns.py` - Pattern tests
- `tests/integration/test_hot_swap.py` - Runtime change tests

#### **Implementation Details:**
Test scenarios:
- Complete workflows
- All patterns
- Runtime changes
- Error recovery
- Performance benchmarks

#### **Example:**
```
Test: Dynamic pattern change
1. Start with sequential pattern
2. Execute partially
3. Change to parallel pattern
4. Verify state preserved
5. Verify execution continues
```

#### **Success Criteria:**
- [ ] All workflows tested
- [ ] Pattern tests complete
- [ ] Runtime changes validated
- [ ] Performance measured
- [ ] Documentation complete
