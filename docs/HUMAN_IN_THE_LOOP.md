# Human-in-the-Loop Documentation

## Overview

Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) capabilities allow human operators to monitor, intervene, guide, and control the multi-agent system at various points during execution.

## Interrupt Architecture

### Types of Interrupts

#### Automatic Interrupts

##### Configuration-Based
Defined during graph compilation:
Interrupt Points:

Before high-risk operations
After critical decisions
On confidence below threshold
At approval checkpoints


##### Condition-Based
Triggered by runtime conditions:
- Error rate exceeds threshold
- Unexpected state detected
- Resource limits approached
- Anomaly detected

##### Tool-Based
Certain tools always require approval:
- Database deletions
- Production deployments
- Financial transactions
- External API calls

#### Manual Interrupts

##### User-Triggered
Human initiates pause:
- Emergency stop button
- Scheduled review
- Quality check
- Debug inspection

##### System-Requested
System asks for help:
- Ambiguous situation
- Missing information
- Conflict resolution
- Strategy decision

### Interrupt Implementation

#### File Locations
- `multiagenticswarm/core/interrupts.py` (To be created)
- `multiagenticswarm/core/human_interface.py` (To be created)

#### Interrupt Flow

##### 1. Interrupt Triggered
Condition Met → Interrupt Signal → Current Node Completes → Execution Pauses

##### 2. Context Preparation
Gather Context:

Current state
Recent history
Decision options
Recommendations


##### 3. Human Notification
Notification Sent:

Interrupt reason
Current context

Time sensitivity


##### 4. Human Review
Human Interface Shows:

State visualization
Decision points
Edit capabilities

##### 5. Human Action
Possible Actions:

Approve/Reject

### Approval Configuration

#### Static Configuration
Defined in advance:
Approvals:
deployment:
required: true
approvers: [admin, devops]
timeout: 30min
data_deletion:
required: true
approvers: [data_owner]
escalation: manager

#### Dynamic Configuration
Determined at runtime:
- Based on data sensitivity
