# Collaboration Patterns Documentation

## Overview

Collaboration patterns define how agents work together. The system can interpret natural language descriptions and implement appropriate patterns dynamically.

## Core Patterns

### 1. Supervisor Pattern

#### Description
A central coordinator (supervisor) manages and directs all other agents.

#### Graph Structure
    [Supervisor]
   /     |      \
[A1]   [A2]    [A3]
   \     |      /
    [Supervisor]

#### When to Use
- Clear hierarchy needed
- Central decision making
- Complex coordination
- Quality control required

#### Implementation Details

##### Supervisor Node
Central coordinator that:
- Receives all inputs
- Assigns tasks to agents
- Reviews outputs
- Makes routing decisions
- Handles conflicts

##### Agent Nodes
Worker agents that:
- Receive specific tasks
- Execute independently
- Report to supervisor
- Don't communicate directly

##### Flow Control
- All requests go through supervisor
- Supervisor can parallelize tasks
- Results aggregated by supervisor
- Supervisor makes final decision

#### Configuration
Pattern Configuration:
type: supervisor
supervisor_agent: coordinator
worker_agents: [agent1, agent2, agent3]
routing_strategy: capability_based
aggregation_method: supervisor_decision

### 2. Sequential Pattern

#### Description
Agents work in a defined sequence, each building on the previous agent's work.

#### Graph Structure
[A1] → [A2] → [A3] → [A4] → [End]

#### When to Use
- Clear task dependencies
- Pipeline processing
- Step-by-step refinement
- Order matters

#### Implementation Details

##### Chain Structure
- Linear flow of execution
- Each agent completes before next
- State passed along chain
- No parallel execution

##### Handoff Points
- Clear input/output contracts
- State transformation at each step
- Error propagation along chain
- Skip capability for failures

#### Configuration
Pattern Configuration:
type: sequential
sequence: [analyzer, processor, validator, publisher]
error_handling: skip_on_failure
state_passing: cumulative

### 3. Parallel Pattern

#### Description
Multiple agents work simultaneously on different aspects of the same task.

#### Graph Structure
     [Router]
    /    |    \
 [A1]  [A2]  [A3]
    \    |    /
   [Aggregator]

#### When to Use
- Independent subtasks
- Speed is priority
- Resource utilization
- No dependencies

#### Implementation Details

##### Router Node
Distributes work:
- Splits task into subtasks
- Assigns to agents
- Balances load
- Tracks assignments

##### Parallel Execution
- Simultaneous processing
- Independent state branches
- No inter-agent communication
- Isolated failures

##### Aggregator Node
Combines results:
- Waits for all completions
- Merges outputs
- Resolves conflicts
- Produces final result

#### Configuration
Pattern Configuration:
type: parallel
splitter: task_based
agents: [frontend, backend, database]
aggregation: merge_all
timeout: 30s
partial_results: allowed

### 4. Consensus Pattern

#### Description
Multiple agents work on the same task and must agree on the result.

#### Graph Structure
[Distributor]
/     |     \
[A1]   [A2]   [A3]
\     |     /
[Voting]
|
[Decision]

#### When to Use
- High reliability needed
- Multiple perspectives valuable
- Risk mitigation
- Quality assurance

#### Implementation Details

##### Distribution
- Same task to all agents
- Identical inputs
- Independent processing
- No collaboration

##### Voting Mechanism
- Collect all outputs
- Compare results
- Apply voting rules
- Determine consensus

##### Decision Rules
- Unanimous agreement
- Majority vote
- Weighted voting
- Confidence threshold

#### Configuration
Pattern Configuration:
type: consensus
agents: [checker1, checker2, checker3]
voting_method: majority
minimum_votes: 2
tie_breaker: senior_agent

### 5. Competitive Pattern

#### Description
Multiple agents compete to provide the best solution.

#### Graph Structure
[Initiator]
/    |    \
[A1]  [A2]  [A3]
\    |    /
[Evaluator]
|
[Best Result]

#### When to Use
- Quality optimization
- Multiple approaches
- Performance comparison
- Best-of-breed selection

#### Implementation Details

##### Competition Setup
- Same problem to all
- Different approaches allowed
- Time or resource limits
- Independent execution

##### Evaluation Criteria
- Quality metrics
- Performance scores
- Resource efficiency
- Time to completion

##### Selection Process
- Compare all results
- Apply scoring rubric
- Select winner
- Document reasoning

#### Configuration
Pattern Configuration:
type: competitive
competitors: [model1, model2, model3]
evaluation_metrics: [quality, speed, cost]
selection_strategy: highest_score
fallback: use_all_results

### 6. Hybrid Pattern

#### Description
Combines multiple patterns for complex workflows.

#### Graph Structure
Phase 1: Parallel
[Router] → [A1,A2,A3] → [Aggregator]
|
Phase 2: Sequential            [A4]
|
Phase 3: Consensus          [A5,A6,A7]
|
[Final Result]

#### When to Use
- Complex workflows
- Multi-phase operations
- Changing requirements
- Adaptive behavior

#### Implementation Details

##### Phase Management
- Different pattern per phase
- Smooth transitions
- State preservation
- Dynamic switching

##### Pattern Combination
- Nested patterns
- Conditional patterns
- Recursive patterns
- Adaptive patterns

#### Configuration
Pattern Configuration:
type: hybrid
phases:
- phase: data_gathering
pattern: parallel
agents: [scraper1, scraper2, api_caller]
- phase: processing
  pattern: sequential
  agents: [cleaner, transformer, analyzer]

- phase: validation
  pattern: consensus
  agents: [validator1, validator2, validator3]

## Pattern Detection

### Natural Language Processing

#### File Location
`multiagenticswarm/core/pattern_detector.py` (To be created)

#### Detection Process

##### 1. Keyword Analysis
Look for pattern indicators:
- "in parallel" → Parallel pattern
- "step by step" → Sequential pattern
- "coordinate" → Supervisor pattern
- "vote on" → Consensus pattern
- "best solution" → Competitive pattern

##### 2. Relationship Extraction
Identify agent relationships:
- Dependencies between agents
- Coordination requirements
- Communication patterns
- Decision points

##### 3. Flow Analysis
Understand execution flow:
- Concurrent vs sequential
- Branching points
- Merge points
- Loops and conditions

##### 4. Pattern Matching
Match to known patterns:
- Compare to pattern library
- Score pattern fitness
- Select best match
- Handle ambiguity

## Pattern Composition

### Nested Patterns

#### Pattern Within Pattern
Example: Parallel pattern where each parallel branch is sequential
Main: Parallel
├── Branch 1: Sequential [A→B→C]
├── Branch 2: Sequential [D→E→F]
└── Branch 3: Sequential [G→H→I]

### Conditional Patterns

#### Runtime Pattern Selection
Pattern chosen based on conditions:
If data_size > threshold:
Use Parallel Pattern
Else:
Use Sequential Pattern

### Recursive Patterns

#### Self-Referential Patterns
Pattern that can invoke itself:
Divide and Conquer:
├── If task_simple: Execute
└── Else:
├── Split task
└── Recursively apply pattern
